# PyGraphAlgorithm

This script contains a simple graph and some useful functions

### Function List
+ BFS
+ DFS
+ TopologicalSort\_indgree
+ TopologicalSort\_dfs
+ Kruskal
+ Prim
+ Dijikstra
+ Bellman-Ford
+ Floyd

First,type in the vertices ,-1 for an end;  
Then type in the edges in the format of vertice1 vertice2 cost line by line for an end;  
then it will run the above functions.
